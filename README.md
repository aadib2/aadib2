## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aadi!
ðŸŽ“ Rising Junior at San Diego State University, studying Computer Science with minor in Math
ðŸŒ± Aspiring ML / AI Engineer and Data Scientist | Passionate about Sustainability, STEM Education, and Scientific Research

I am a detail-oriented and curious problem solver and collaborator who is passionate about tackling real-world issues through predictive modeling techniques, data analysis, and developing applications. I'm very keen and eager to continue to grow both as a student and professional through continuous learning, building new skills or refining existing ones (both technical and soft), networking with peers and professionals, and leadership. I am currently focused on learning about ML/AI concepts and developing machine learning models, creating data pipelines, and learning about backend programming and deployment processes through research experiences and self-learning / personal-projects. I'm looking to leverage my knowledge and skills in an internship for Summer 2026 where I can contribute to exciting and impactful real-world projects and grow and learn from industry and research professionals as well as my peers. 

This summer, I was an undergrad researcher working with an interdisciplinary team of undergrads in the SDSU Department of Astronomy where we applied data science and machine learning techniques to astronomical data collected by the newly-built Vera Rubin Observatory to aid in scientific discovery and analysis of pulsating variable stars. I am also an incoming undergrad research assistant with the AI4Business Lab and Break Through Tech Fellow!
