### 🎓 CS & Math @ San Diego State University<br/>
### 📕 Undergraduate Researcher & AI Enthusiast<br/>
### 💻 Aspiring ML/AI Engineer and Software Developer<br/>

I am a curious, detail-oriented problem solver and collaborator who is passionate about applying software development, machine learning, and data science to tackle real-world challenges that provide value to communities. I enjoy collaborating on interdisciplinary teams and continuously growing through hands-on learning, research, and leadership experiences. I'm looking to leverage my knowledge and skills in a Summer 2026 technology internship where I can contribute to exciting and impactful real-world projects and grow and learn alongside industry and research professionals.

Most recently, I was working as an undergrad researcher in the SDSU Department of Astronomy where our team applied data science and ML techniques to astronomical data collected by the Vera Rubin Observatory, assisting with scientific discovery and analysis of pulsating variable stars. Currently, I'm a [Break Through Tech](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/) Fellow where, through our *AI Studio* project, my team is working with [Anote](https://anote.ai/) on synthetic data generation for computer vision tasks.

**💭 Currently Learning:** Databases (SQL), Backend Programming, LLMs + RAG

### 🎯 Featured Project: [Synthetic Image Gen for Anote](https://github.com/anote-ai/btt-anote2a)
- **What We Did**: Researched and implemented synthetic image generation pipeline for computer vision models using both diffusion models (OpenAI API) and the BlenderProc SDK in combination with image processing tools like cv2 and pycocotools
- **Tools:** Python, Flask, React.js (UI), OpenAI API, blenderproc, ultralytics, pymongo + boto3 (image storage)
- **Result:** 80%+ reduction in manual annotation time, customizable parameters (e.g. number images, background, lighting, scenes), COCO + YOLO exportable formats, provided insights and informed business decisions for Anote SyntheticDataGen SDK & API

➡️ Check out the complete project here! (coming soon)
