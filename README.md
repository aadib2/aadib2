## Hi there 👋 I'm Aadi!
🎓 Rising Junior at San Diego State University, studying Computer Science with minor in Math

👨🏻‍💻 Aspiring ML / AI Engineer and Data Scientist | Passionate about Scientific Research, STEM Education, and Sustainability

I am a detail-oriented and curious problem solver and collaborator who is passionate about tackling real-world issues through data analysis, predictive modeling techniques, and developing useful applications. I'm very keen and eager to continue to grow both as a student and professional through continuously learning, building new skills or refining existing ones (both technical and soft), networking with peers and professionals, and through leadership. I am currently focused on exploring ML/AI concepts and developing machine learning models, creating data pipelines, and learning backend programming and deployment processes through research experiences and self-learning / personal-projects. I'm looking to leverage my knowledge and skills in an internship for Summer 2026 where I can contribute to exciting and impactful real-world projects and grow and learn from industry and research professionals.

Most recently, I worked as an undergrad researcher working with an interdisciplinary team of undergrads in the SDSU Department of Astronomy where our team applied data science and machine learning techniques to astronomical data collected by the Vera Rubin Observatory to aid in scientific discovery and analysis of pulsating variable stars. I am also an incoming undergrad research assistant with the SDSU AI4Business Lab and [Break Through Tech](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/) Fellow.
